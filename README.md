# FCE_Attrition
Problem Statemet: A finance company is sending their employees to collect EMIs from the customer. They are called Field collection Agents (FCE).
Find groups of FCEs who are likely to leave, so that company can take appropriate measures <br/>

## Approach:
Unsupervised learning algorithm is used to create clusters. The features are created based on their years of experience, age, rewards, appraisal performance.<br/>
Cluster classifcation (determine which group of FCEs are prone to leave the company) is done based on their attrition rate.
